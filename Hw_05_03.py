#Write a program that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers
#until the user enters 'done'. Once 'done' is entered, print out
#the TOTAL, COUNT and AVERAGE of the numbers. If the user enters anything
#other than a valid number catch it with a try/except and put out an
#appropriate message and ignore the number. Enter 7, 2, bob, 10, and 4
#and match the output below.

#invalid input
#Total is 23
#Count is 4
#Average is 5.75
